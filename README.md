# PhysX-lite

A fork of NVIDIA PhysX SDK 4.1 which reduces the repository size from 623 MB down to 40 MB. Many things have been removed:
* documentation
* samples
* Kapla demo
* PhysXGpu DLLs
* dependencies only relevant to samples

## Why?
A few months ago, I tried cloning PhysX and it took approximately 2 hours to download. With `--depth=1`, the .git folder was about 700 MB. I found that rather annoying, so 3 days ago, I decided to trim it down a bit, surprised I haven't found anything similar to this fork.  

I hope this will be useful to anybody who wants to use PhysX as a git submodule, who perhaps has slow Internet speeds, and anything alike.

## Introduction

Welcome to the NVIDIA PhysX SDK source code repository. This depot includes the PhysX SDK and the Kapla Demo application.

The NVIDIA PhysX SDK is a scalable multi-platform physics solution supporting a wide range of devices, from smartphones to high-end multicore CPUs and GPUs. PhysX is already integrated into some of the most popular game engines, including Unreal Engine, and Unity3D. [PhysX SDK on developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk).

## Documentation

Please see [Release Notes](http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/release_notes.html) for updates pertaining to the latest version.

The full set of documentation can also be found in the repository under physx/documentation or online at http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/simulation.html

## Quick Start Instructions

Requirements:
* Python 2.7.6 or later
* CMake 3.12 or later

To begin, clone this repository onto your local drive.  Then change directory to physx/, run ./generate_projects.[bat|sh] and follow on-screen prompts.  This will let you select a platform specific solution to build.  You can then open the generated solution file with your IDE and kick off one or more configuration builds.

To build and run the Kapla Demo see [kaplademo/README.md](kaplademo/README.md).
